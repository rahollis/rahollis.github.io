Proficiency Exams
===================

On this page, you will find links to pages containing sample rubrics for each of the proficiency exams.
At the top of each rubric will be links to sample exams (from last semester) along with answer sheets for those sample exams.
*Please note* that the rubrics need not match the exams given in class.  They are meant to give you an idea for how I will grade each exam.

I will not post a sample final exam or rubrics.

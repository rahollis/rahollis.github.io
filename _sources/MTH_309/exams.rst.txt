Proficiency Exams
===================

On this page, you will find links to pages containing sample rubrics for each of the proficiency exams.
At the top of each rubric will be links to sample exams (from last semester).  I will not post answers.
*Please note* that the rubrics are only meant to give you an idea for how I will grade each problem and may change.

The final exam will be composed mainly of questions from these 6 exams, so I will not post a sample final exam or rubrics.

Course Information
------------------

**Text book:** "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares" by Boyd and Vandenberghe.
You can find the book as a free PDF `here <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/>`_.

**Lecture Outlines:** You will find the outlines that I use for preparing my lectures
`here <https://ubuffalo-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/rahollis_buffalo_edu/EsGsB_StmhpPqo1aph7u2UQBitrdYfPfLxtveUOXEk1G2w?e=gEcKVd>`_.  
I encourage you to use these outlines as templates for your own notes.

**Software.** We will be using the `Anaconda distribution of Python 3.8 <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_.
This is free software. Even if you have Python already installed on your computer you should install this
distribution since it includes Jupyter notebook and several Python modules we will need.

**Laptop.** Since we will be using Jupyter notebook every week, you should have a laptop or tablet with you during class.

**Useful links for Jupyter.**

    * `Markdown cheatsheet <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>`_.  Markdown is a scheme used
      to format text in Jupyter notebook.
    * `LaTeX math symbols <https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols>`_ - this is useful reference for
      typesetting mathematics with Jupyter notebook.
    * `Python 3 documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_. This is the official documentation of Python 3.
      See the Tutorial section for introduction to Python and Library Reference for a systematic description of standard
      Python tools.
    * `matplotlib documentation <http://matplotlib.org>`_. Matplotlib is a Python module for creating graphs and plots.
      We will use it a lot. Matplotlib documentation is unfortunately incomplete and often quite confusing, but it includes many
      code examples that can be helpful.
    * `numpy documentation <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/>`_. Numpy is the main scientific computing module of Python.
      We will use it extensively.

**Learning Goals:**

    * Construct a system of linear equations from an application.
    * Represent a system of linear equations in matrix form.
    * Solve a system of equations with and without the aid of technology.
    * Determine if a given set of vectors is a subspace of :math:`\mathbb{R}^n`.
    * Find a basis for a given subspace of :math:`\mathbb{R}^n` and determine its dimension.
    * Convert a vector from one coordinate basis to another.
    * Find a matrix representation of a linear transformation between :math:`\mathbb{R}^n` and :math:`\mathbb{R}^m`.
    * Add, multiply, and transpose matrices.
    * Determine if a matrix is invertible and compute its inverse if it is.
    * Identify if a set of vectors is orthogonal.
    * Identify if a matrix is orthogonal.
    * Construct an orthonormal basis for a given subspace.
    * Compute the orthonormal projection of a vector onto a subspace.
    * Calculate the area of a parallelogram using determinant.
    * Understand the connection between determinant and the geometry of linear transformations.
    * Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
    * Apply eigenvalues/vectors to solve systems of LODEs.
    * Solve the least squares problem.
    * Compute the singular value decomposition.
    * Understand how to use computer software to aid in all of the above.


Recitation Information

Grade Information
-----------------

Grades are available in an online spreadsheet 
`here <https://ubuffalo-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/rahollis_buffalo_edu/EcdVKftifvZMhhqkR4smi0EB4S-YI70T9dpcTcfQThQOPA?e=q0bYeZ>`_,
and are listed by a grade code that I will email you during week 2.

Grades will be calculated as follows:

+-------+----------+------------+---------------+------------+
| Exams | Homework | Activities | Participation | Final Exam |
+-------+----------+------------+---------------+------------+
| 65%   | 15%      |  15%       | 5%            |     20%    |
+-------+----------+------------+---------------+------------+
This table adds up to 120%! For an explanation, check under *Final Exam*.

Grades will be calculated using the standard grade scale:

+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  F  |  D  |  D+ |  C- |  C  |  C+ |  B- |  B  |  B+ |  A- |  A  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0   | 60  | 64  | 67  | 70  | 74  | 77  | 80  | 84  | 87  | 90  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
Please note that the values in this table are the lower threshold for each letter grade.

*Homework:* We will be using `UBx <https://learning.buffalo.edu/>`_ for homework.  There will be one assignment every 2 weeks, due on Fridays.  
For specific due dates consult the tentative calendar near the end of this syllabus.

UBx uses Python to automatically generate and grade questions.  In addition, there are some problems that will require you to work in Jupyter notebook, 
so you will need to download and install the latest version of `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.
Don't worry, any programming you will need to do will be minimal and thoroughly explained in the problem.

*In-class activities:* In addition to the biweekly homework, we will have `in-class activities <activities>`_ every week.  
These activities will be done during class, turned in as a PDF on Brightspace, and graded (part of the grade will be completion).  
The lowest two grades will be dropped.

*Recitation participation:* It couldn't be easier to get 5% of the final grade, just show up and engage.  
Participation in recitation will be evaluated by the TA on a weekly basis.  
You will be allowed 2 absences without a grade penalty.

*Proficiency exams:* Exams in this class will be handled differently than what you may be used to.  
Instead of having one or two midterms covering multiple sections of material, we will have short, 25 minute exams 
covering only the material from the previous 2 weeks.  Exams will take place the first half of class on the designated exam days (see tenative schedule).
**Do not leave after finishing the exams because we will cover new material for the second half of class.**

Each exam will have 4 questions worth 4 points each for a total of 16 points.  
If your score is 14 or more, you pass the exam and will receive a 100%.  
If your score is 12 or 13 it will be considered a marginal pass and you will receive a 70%.
If your score is 11 or less, you do not pass the exam and will receive 0%.
  
If you are unhappy with your score on the exam, you will have the opportunity to retake it.  *If you opt to retake an exam, only your retake grade will be counted.*  
You must have made an honest attempt the first time to be permitted to retake an exam. 
**Exam retakes will take place during the first 25 minutes of class on the designated days.**
If you are not retaking the exam, you do not need to show up to the first 25 minutes of class on those days.  
**We will still cover new material after exams and retakes.**

Exam 7 retake will be handled differently.  Since exam 7 is on the last day of class, the retake will be incorporated into the final exam period.

Your aggregate score for the proficiency exams portion of the final grade will be the average of the individual exam grades (100 for passing, 70 for a marginal pass, 0 otherwise).
There will be a total of seven proficiency exams.

*Final exam:* **If your average grade on the first 6 exams is at least 75%, you may opt out of the final exam.**  You may still show up to the final exam period
to take the exam 7 retake, but will not be required to take the final exam.
If your average grade on the first 6 exams is less than 75%, you will be required to take the final exam, 
and if you don't, you will receive a 0 on the final exam.

For those of you that end up taking the final exam, I will reduce the weight of the proficiency exams from 65% of the final grade to 45% of the final grade, 
with the final exam making up the remaining 20%.

The final exam will have one question from each of the 7 proficiency exams, and you will have 1.5 hours to complete it.  The exam 7 retake will take place
after the final exam has been collected, and you will be given 25 minutes to complete it.

The final exam will be Wednesday, May 15 11:45 AM - 1:15 PM.
The exam 7 retake will be Wednesday, May 15 1:20 - 1:45 PM.

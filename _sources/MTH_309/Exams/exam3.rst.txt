Each question will be graded out of 4 points, with partial credit
given for incomplete or incorrect answers.  To pass the exam, you
will need at least 10 points total, which is an average of 2.5
for each question.

Next to each part of the rubrics, you will see error codes in
square brackets.  These error codes are will be used to indicate
why any points were taken off on your exam papers.

Below are the rubrics for exam 3.

(2 pts) What happens to basis vectors
	(-1 pt) One of the basis vectors is missing or incorrect [IB]

	(-2 pt) Both of the basis vectors are missing or incorrect [IB2]
(1 pt) Arrange outputs into matrix
	(-1 pt) Did not arrange into matrix, or matrix is incorrect [IM]

Question 3
~~~~~~~~~~

True or False?

(1 pt) Correct answer
	(-1 pt) Answer is either incorrect or missing [IA]
(3 pts) Explain answer
	Answer TRUE
		Provided reasoning (3 points possible)
			(-0 pts) Reasoning is sound and provides a proof

			(-1 pt) Reasoning is sound but not a proof [SR]

			(-3 pts) Reasoning is not sound [NS]
		Provided an example (2 points possible)
			(-0 pts) Example supports an answer of TRUE [EX]

			(-1 pt) Example supports an answer of FALSE (is a counterexample) [CX]

			(-2 pts) Example is not relevant [NR]
	Answer FALSE
		Provided reasoning (3 points possible)
			(-0 pts) Reasoning provides a proof of the negative

			(-2 pts) Reasoning is sound but not a proof of the negative [SR]

			(-3 pts) Reasoning is not sound [NS]
		Provided an example (3 points possible)
			(-0 pts) Example supports an answer of FALSE (is a counterexample)

			(-2 pts) Example supports an answer of TRUE [EX]

			(-3 pts) Example is not relevant [NR]

Question 4
~~~~~~~~~~

Is the linear transformation 1-1 (or onto)?

(1 pt) Find matrix representation.
	(-1 pt) Matrix representation is incorrect [MR]
(1 pt) Compute echelon form and locate pivots.
	(-1 pt) Echelon form is incorrect [EF]
(2 pts) Answer question and explain.
	Answer YES
		(-0 pts) Pivot in every row (or column)

		(-1 pt) Pivot location does not match answer (e.g. say it is onto because pivot in every column) [PL]

		(-2 pts) Answer does not mention pivots [NP]
	Answer NO
		(-0 pts) Row or column missing a pivot

		(-1 pt) Missing pivot does not match answer (e.g. say it is not 1-1 because row missing pivot) [PL]

		(-2 pts) Answer does not mention pivots [NP]

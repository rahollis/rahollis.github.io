Exam 7
======

`Sample exam 7 <../../_static/MTH_309/exam_7_sample.pdf>`_

Each question will be graded out of 4 points, with partial credit
given for incomplete or incorrect answers.  To pass the exam, you
will need at least 12 points total, which is an average score of 3 
for each question.  A score of 12 or 13 will receive a 70% and
a score of 14 or above will receive 100%.

Next to each part of the rubrics, you will see error codes in
square brackets.  These error codes are will be used to indicate
why any points were taken off on your exam papers.

Below are the rubrics for exam 7.

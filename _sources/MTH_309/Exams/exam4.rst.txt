Exam 4
======

`Sample exam 4 <../../_static/MTH_309/exam_4_sample.pdf>`_

Each question will be graded out of 4 points, with partial credit
given for incomplete or incorrect answers.  To pass the exam, you
will need at least 10 points total, which is an average of 2.5
for each question.

Next to each part of the rubrics, you will see error codes in
square brackets.  These error codes are will be used to indicate
why any points were taken off on your exam papers.

Below are the rubrics for exam 4.

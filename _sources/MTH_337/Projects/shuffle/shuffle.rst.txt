Shuffling cards
---------------

Shuffling is the process of randomizing a deck of cards.  In this
project, we will investigate different methods used to shuffle cards,
with the goal of comparing how each method randomizes a deck.

This project will require extensive use of the :code:`random` library.

**Exercise:** Write a Python function that takes a positive integer
as input and returns a "deck" containing the specified number of cards.
In other words, you want to return a list of integers between 1 and 
:math:`n`.

We will consider three methods of shuffling:  the classic riffle,
the middle-out method, and the overhand shuffle.

*The classic riffle*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this method, the deck is divided roughly in half and the halves
held in separate hands.  A new deck is built from the bottom up by
selecting at random either the bottom card from the left hand or right
hand.  This is done repeatedly until all the cards are gone from 
either hand, at which point any remaining cards (in the other hand)
are placed on the top of the deck.

*The middle-out method*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simpler than the riffle, this method first divides the deck into
roughly thirds.  The middle third is then placed randomly on the top
or the bottom of the deck.

*Overhand shuffle*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this shuffle, the originial deck is held in the right hand and the shuffled 
deck is the left hand.  A section of cards is moved from the top of
the original deck to the top of the shuffled deck.  This is repeated until there
are no more cards left in the original deck.

Measuring randomness
--------------------

Given a list of integers

.. math::
   [n_1,n_2,...,n_k], 

how random are they distributed?  One possible measure of randomness 
is to compute the average distances between adjacent integers

.. math::
   \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}|n_{i+1}-n_i|.

This measure is fine, but it has some drawbacks.  Consider the follwing
deck

.. math::
   [1,27,2,28,3,29,4,30,...,26,52].

The above measure would be about 23.25, about as high as possible;
however, we can clearly see that this is not a random deck.  How
might we modify the measure to avoid this drawback?

**Exercise:** Write a function that takes a randomized deck as input
and returns its measure of randomness.

Project
-------

**Part 1:**  For each of the three shuffling methods, write a function
that takes a "deck of cards" as input and returns the shuffled deck.

**Part 2:**  Compare the performance of the methods.  Which method acheived
the most randomness?  Which method achieved an acceptable level of
randomness the fastest?  Use plots to display your findings.

**Extra credit:**  Write a function to perform a different shuffling
method and compare to the other three.  For credit, your new shuffle
must be physically possible.  I may ask you to demonstrate your shuffle
for me in office hours.

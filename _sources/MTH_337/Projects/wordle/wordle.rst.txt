Worlde
==================

.. rubric:: 

**Wordle** is a word puzzle where you try to guess a hidden word.  Each time you make a guess, you are told
which letters are correct, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are
incorrect.  The best way to learn is to play. `<https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html>`__.

The standard wordle uses a hidden 5-letter word, and the player has 6 guesses to get the right answer.
Each time the player makes a guess, the letters from the guess that are in the hidden word are highlighted:
green if the letter is in the right position, yellow if it is not in the right position.  The game also
keeps track of all the letters the player has used along with whether or not the used letters appear in the
hidden word.

Project
-------

Write a function that, when called, allows the user to play wordle.  For this project, you will need to use
the :code:`input` function to allow the user to make their guesses.

**Note.**  This is a programming project. Your project report does not need
include narrative, beyond comments explaining how your code works. The project will
be graded according to the following rubrics:

* Code that successfully solves the simple sodoku: 70%
* Report organization and code documentation: 30%

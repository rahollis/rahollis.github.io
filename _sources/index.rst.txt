Course Resources
----------------

**Laptop.** We will be programming during all class meetings, so you should bring
a laptop to every class. Any operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) is fine.

**Software.** We will be using the `Anaconda distribution of Python 3.8 <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_.
This is free software. Even if you have Python already installed on your computer you should install this
distribution since it includes Jupyter notebook and several Python modules we will need.



**Textbook.** There is no required textbook for this course but the following resorces may be helpful:

    * `MTH 337 notes <http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~adamcunn/spring2017/_downloads/MTH337ClassnotesSpring2017.pdf>`_ by prof. Adam Cunningham.
      These notes provide a concise introduction to Jupyter notebook and Python.
    * `Markdown cheatsheet <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>`_.  Markdown is a scheme used
      to format text in Jupyter notebook.
    * `LaTeX math symbols <https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols>`_ - this is useful reference for
      typesetting mathematics with Jupyter notebook.
    * `Python 3 documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_. This is the official documentation of Python 3.
      See the Tutorial section for introduction to Python and Library Reference for a systematic description of standard
      Python tools.
    * `matplotlib documentation <http://matplotlib.org>`_. Matplotlib is a Python module for creating graphs and plots.
      We will use it a lot. Matplotlib documentation is unfortunately incomplete and often quite confusing, but it includes many
      code examples that can be helpful.
    * `numpy documentation <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/>`_. Numpy is the main scientific computing module of Python.
      We will use it extensively.


|UBLearns| will be used mainly for submitting project reports.  Grades will be available upon request during office hours.

Grading
-------

There will be no exams in this course. Instead, grades will be assigned based on
the following components:

    * Project Reports 70%
    * Quizzes 20%
    * Class Participation 10%


**Project Reports.**
The main component of this course will be exploratory projects. You will be
working on them largely independently, using mathematical and computing tools.
The outcome of your work on each project will be a project report that you will
submit for grading. Each report will be graded on the A-F scale. Extra credit may
be assigned for an outstanding work. Reports will be submitted via UBLearns.
Late reports will not be accepted.  Your project report must be an original, 
even if you worked on some components of the project in a group.
More information about project reports is posted :doc:`here <report_guide>`.
The lowest project score will be dropped at the end of the semester.

**Quizzes.** Each Monday there will be a short quiz testing your knowledge of Python.
Sample quizzes will be posted ahead of time with the :doc:`weekly class schedule <weekly_schedule>`.
The lowest two quiz score will be dropped.

**Class Participation.** This includes class attendance, asking and answering question in class
and during office hours.  Class participation will be evaluated weekly.



Useful Information
------------------

**COVID-19 Information**
Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, high-quality masks must be worn at all times during class.  If I notice that you
do not have a mask on, I will ask you to either put one on or leave the classroom.  Please make sure your
mask covers both your mouth and nose and fits tightly on your face without gaps between your mask and your
face.  I may ask you to leave the classroom if your mask does not fit tightly.  As per University policy, 
cloth masks, scarves, bandanas, etc. do not count as high-quality masks, please use an N95 or KN95 or similar
mask.  For more information at the pandemic health and safety policies, please see the
`Health and Safety Guidelines <https://www.buffalo.edu/coronavirus/health-and-safety/health-safety-guidelines.html>`_.

**Important Dates:**
	
        * Jan 31: first day of classes
	* Feb 7: last day to drop/add
	* Mar 21 - 25: Fall recess
	* Apr 22: last day to resign
	* May 13: last day of classes

**Academic Integrity.**
Academic integrity is critical to the learning process. It is your responsibility as a student to
complete your work in an honest fashion, upholding the expectations your individual instructors
have for you in this regard. The ultimate goal is to ensure that you learn the content in your
courses in accordance with UB's academic integrity principles, regardless of whether instruction
is in-person or remote. Thank you for upholding your own personal integrity and ensuring UB's
tradition of academic excellence. The academic integrity policy is available at:
 `Academic Integrity <https://www.buffalo.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_

While you are encouraged to collaborate with your peers to problem solve while working on the projects,
each student is responsible for producing an original project report on their own.  Any outside resource 
that is used during the project (this includes code taken from class notes or other sources) or while 
writing the report must be properly cited in the report. 

Collaboration of any kind on the quizzes is forbidden, as is the use of any materials not approved of 
by the instructor.

**Accessibility Resources.**
If you have any disability which requires reasonable accommodations to enable you to participate
in this course, please contact the Oce of Accessibility Resources in 60 Capen Hall, 716-645-2608
and also the instructor of this course during the first week of class. The office will provide you
with information and review appropriate arrangements for reasonable accommodations, which can
be found on the web at:
 `Accessibility Resources <http://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-we-are/departments/accessibility.html>`_.

**Critical Campus Resources**

**Sexual Violence.**
UB is committed to providing a safe learning environment free of all forms of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual assault, domestic and dating violence and stalking. If you have experienced gender-based violence (intimate partner violence, attempted or completed sexual assault, harassment, coercion, stalking, etc.), UB has resources to help. This includes academic accommodations, health and counseling services, housing accommodations, helping with legal protective orders, and assistance with reporting the incident to police or other UB officials if you so choose.

Message decryption
==================

.. rubric:: (due: Monday, April 27, 10:00 PM)


Message encryption is necessary to ensure safe transmission of data.


Messages can be encrypted by changing the order of the characters in the message.


Consider the example: 'Luke, I am your father'

The encryption is done following these steps:

-  An integer number **c** is chosen at random. (say c=3)

-  The message is then written in a **n x c  array** (extra characters '&' might be needed if the string is too short). The dimension **n** is determined by the length of the string and the value of **c**. So the corresponding array for our message looks like this:

+---+---+---+
| L | u | k |
+---+---+---+
| e | , |   |
+---+---+---+
| I |   | a |
+---+---+---+
| m |   | y |
+---+---+---+
| o | u | r |
+---+---+---+
|   | f | a |
+---+---+---+
| t | h | e |
+---+---+---+
| r | & | & |
+---+---+---+

-  The encrypted message is obtained from the transpose array (after removing the extra characters '&'):

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| L | e | I | m | o |   | t | r |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| u | , |   |   | u | f | h | & |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| k |   | a | y | r | a | e | & |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

**Encrypted message**: 'LeImo tru,  ufhk ayrae'

Project
-------

Each file listed below contains text (a fragment of a book in English)
encrypted using the method described above choosing **c** at random in the [25,100] interval. 

Write a function **decrypt('txtfile')** that decrypts the file assigned to you and print the decrypted message. The function should take as a variable the name of your .txt file.

**Note.**  This is a programming project. Your project report does not need
include narrative, beyond comments explaining how your code works. The project will
be graded according to the following rubrics:

* Code that successfully decrypts the text file: 70%
* Report organization and code documentation: 30%

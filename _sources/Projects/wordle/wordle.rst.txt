.. rubric:: (due: Sunday, Dec 11, 11:59 PM)

**Wordle** is a word puzzle where you try to guess a hidden word.  Each time you make a guess, you are told
which letters are correct, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are
incorrect.  The best way to learn is to play. `<https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html>`__.

The standard wordle uses a hidden 5-letter word, and the player has 6 guesses to get the right answer.

Redistricting
=============

.. rubric:: (due: Wednesday, Nov 2 at 11:59 PM)

In the US, the people are represented in Congress by representatives elected by the people of their state.
Each state is partitioned into several congressional districts, and one representative is elected from each
district.  These congressional districts are also used when the state is distributing money for schools,
infrastructure, social programs, and more.

Every 10 years, after the decennial national census, the congressional district borders in every state are
redrawn in a process known as *redistricting*.  There are many criteria that those in charge of the
redistricting process use when redrawing the congressional district lines, including

* equal population in each district,
* shapes of the districts,
* political lean of each district,
* majority minority districts to ensure representation of the minority.

In this project we will focus on the first three of these criteria.

Equal population
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to guarantee that each person gets equal representation, each representative sent to Congress
should be representing the same number of persons.  This means that a "good" district map should have
districts with equal population.  For our model, we will assume that each "census block" has exactly 
the same population.

District shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another desireable quality for congressional district maps is for the districts to have a "regular" shape.
Consider the following district map, and notice the shape of the district labeled 19.

.. figure:: new_york2020.jpeg

    :align: center

This district does not have a "regular" shape.  The more "centralized" (circular) a district is, the better.

Political lean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A major problem with drawing district maps is that it is often done in order to favor one political party
over another.  This is called "gerrymandering" and is accomplished by using two methods to cheat the system:
"cracking" and "packing".  Cracking is when an area with a high concentration of people who favor the
opposing party is split into two or more districts in order to dilute their political power.  Packing is
when disparate communities are packed into an oddly shaped district in order to concentrate the political 
power of the opposing party into one district.

Scoring a district map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any given map, there is an astromonically large number of possible ways to draw the district borders,
but not all of these are "good", in fact most of them are quite bad.  Imagine you are the person responsible
for redrawing the district lines.  How do you compare two different district maps?  One way to do this would
be to assign a numerical score to each district map and keep the map with the better score.  

In reality, the way a map is scored can be very complicated due to all the factors taken into account.  We
will make a few simplifying assumptions to make this more managable.  The first assumption is that we will 
only be working with maps in which all the districts have the same size (or as close to the same size as
possible).  We will also assume that each "census block" has exactly the same number of people, making all
blocks equal population.  Thus we can measure population in terms of blocks, so the population of a district
is equal to its area.

To measure how regularly shaped the districts are, we can calculate the perimeter-area ratio (PAR) of each 
district.  The shape with the lowest PAR is a circle with a value of :math:`2\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{A}}` where 
:math:`A` is the area of the circle.  All other shapes with the same area will have a PAR larger than this, 
and as the area increases, this lower bound will decrease to zero.  The shape metric will be the PAR of a 
circle with area equal to that of the average district divided by the average of the district PARs.

There will be two political parties, party A and party B.  Assume we know the overall political lean of the 
map in terms of a percentage favoring party A, :math:`p`.  We can calculate the percentage of the districts 
that favor party A, :math:`p_{map}` and measure how well the map reflects the overall political lean using 
percent difference, :math:`1-\frac{|p-p_{map}|}{p}`.

Assuming there are :math:`k` districts with average area :math:`A` and political lean :math:`p`, the map
score is

.. math:: \alpha\cdot\left(\frac{2k\sqrt{\pi}}{A\sum\{\text{district PARs}\}}\right) + (1-\alpha)\cdot\left(1-\frac{|p-p_{map}|}{p}\right)

where :math:`\alpha` is a parameter between 0 and 1 which indicates how much priority is given to the shape
metric.

Automating redistricting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of this project is to write code that can model the redistricting process using the
criteria listed above.  In particular, we will use a monte carlo Markov chain process to go from a starting
map to an acceptable district map by making changes that will increase the map score in the long term.

Our maps will consist of a :math:`n \times n` array of *census blocks*, each treated as having population 1. 
The districts will be made up of groups of neighboring blocks with the same array value.  Below is an example
of what this might look like with a 100x100 map of 7 districts.

.. figure:: random_districts.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center

You will be given a map containing voter information for each census block in the form of an array of 0s and 
1s.  A census block with a value of 1 indicates that it favors party A, and a block with value 0 favors party
B.

**Exercise:**  Write a function that will generate a starting district map of a given size and with a given 
number of districts.  Remember that the districts should have as close to the same population as possible.

**Exercise:**  Write a function that will calculate the map score of an given district map with given
political lean.

Monte carlo simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *monte carlo simulation* is a mathematical modeling technique where the state of a dynamical system 
(system that changes over time) is updated to a new state by randomly choosing from the collection of all the 
possible states based on the current state.

For this project, we will update the district map by first randomly selecting a district and one of its
neighboring districts.  Then a border block for each district is chosen at random and reassigned to the other
district. This is effectively choosing at random a new map that differs from the current map in only two
border positions.

Markov Chain
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *Markov chain* is a sequence of states of a system where each state is generated from the previous
based on a set of stocastic rules (based on probability).

Once a new district map is selected that differs from the current one in two border positions, the new map 
and the old map will be scored, and the scores compared.  If the new map has a higher score (closer to 1), 
we will keep it.  If the old map has a higher score, we have a probability :math:`p` of keeping it anyways.

We are effectively trying to maximize the map score, but we do not want to settle for a local maximum.  The
reason for using a Markov chain is to avoid getting stuck at a local maximum by giving a way of escaping
by passing a probability test.

**Exercise:**  Write a function that will update a given district map based on the rules described above.

Project
~~~~~~~

Simulate the redistricting process by animating the Markov chain described above using the following code.

.. code:: python
    
    %matplotlib notebook
    
    dist_map = GenerateRandomDistricts(size,num_districts)
    
    fig = plt.figure(figsize = (5,5))
    ax = plt.subplot(111)
    im = ax.imshow(dist_map)
    
    def animate(i):
        global dist_map
        
        dist_map = UpdateDistrictMap(dist_map,vote_map,alpha)
        im.set_data(dist_map)
        return im
    
    anim = FuncAnimation(fig=fig, func=animate, interval=100, blit=True, repeat=False)
    plt.show()


**Extra Credit 1:** To make the simulation more realistic, allow the blocks to have different populations, and 
update your map score calculation accordingly.

**Extra Credit 2:** Add into your model a way to guarantee at least one majority minority district based on a
demographic map.

**Extra Credit 3:** Another way to measure the shape of a district is to use the *centering metric*.  This
metric calculates the *center* of the district and takes the standard deviation of distance from the center
of each block in the district.  Include this metric in your map score.  Be sure to calibrate using centering
metric of a circle with area equal to that of the average district in your map.

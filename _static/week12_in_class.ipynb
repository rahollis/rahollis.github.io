Since 2009, scientists around the globe have worked to create&nbsp;the Human Connectome, a structural blueprint of the various neural pathways and connections that underlie thought, reason, emotion, and behavior in the brain. Thanks to those pioneering efforts, we now understand that different regions of the brain work together in concert, forming specific networks that facilitate movement, or learning, or our interactions with others&mdash;the cognitive skills that allow us to survive and thrive in our daily lives. Yet despite these advances, it&rsquo;s still not entirely clear how these networks may differ from person to person.&nbsp;Sarah Muldoon, a mathematician at the University of Buffalo, has long been interested in understanding individual differences in the brain.</div></div></div><div class=\"teaser-clear\"></div></div></div></li><li class=\"flexmodule-style flexmodule-style-largeimg slide-hidden\"><div class=\"page\"><div id=\"ubcms-gen-817947072\" class=\"teaser teaser-block \"><div class=\"teaser-inner\"><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"teaser-images\"><div class=\"teaser-image\"><a tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <noscript><picture><source type=\"image/jpeg\" media=\"(max-width: 568px)\" srcset=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.448.280.q50.jpg/1556892999359.jpg, /content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.576.361.q50.jpg/1556892999359.jpg 2x\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" media=\"(max-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.688.431.q80.jpg/1556892999359.jpg\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.209.131.jpg/1556892999359.jpg, /content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.418.262.q65.jpg/1556892999359.jpg 2x\"><img height=\"131\" alt=\"Mark Marino wins the 2018-2019 Milton Plesur Award for Excellence in Teaching. \" width=\"209\" class=\"img-209 img-209x131 cq-dd-image\" src=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/_jcr_content/par/image.img.209.131.jpg/1556892999359.jpg\" srcset=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.418.262.q65.jpg/1556892999359.jpg 2x\"></picture></noscript><picture class=\"no-display\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" media=\"(max-width: 568px)\" data-srcset=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.448.280.q50.jpg/1556892999359.jpg, /content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.576.361.q50.jpg/1556892999359.jpg 2x\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" media=\"(max-width: 720px)\" data-srcset=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.688.431.q80.jpg/1556892999359.jpg\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" data-srcset=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.209.131.jpg/1556892999359.jpg, /content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.418.262.q65.jpg/1556892999359.jpg 2x\"><img height=\"131\" alt=\"Mark Marino wins the 2018-2019 Milton Plesur Award for Excellence in Teaching. \" width=\"209\" class=\"img-209 img-209x131 cq-dd-image lazyload\" data-src=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr%3acontent/par/image.img.209.131.jpg/1556892999359.jpg\" src=\"//www.buffalo.edu/etc/designs/default/0.gif\" data-srcset=\"/content/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins/jcr:content/par/image.img.418.262.q65.jpg/1556892999359.jpg 2x\"></picture><script type=\"text/javascript\">jQuery('picture.no-display').removeClass('no-display');</script></a></div></div><div class=\"teaser-content\"><div class=\"teaser-title\"><a href=\"/cas/math/news-events/news/marino-wins.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Marino wins Milton Plesur Award 2018-2019</a></div><!--noindex--><div class=\"teaser-date\">4/30/19</div><!--endnoindex--><div class=\"teaser-body\">Congratulations to Mark Marino on winning the 2018-2019 Milton Plesur Award for Excellence in Teaching.

LEWIS CARROLL is discovered, playing chess. Golden-haired\\r\\nALICE, in a little blue dress, a black kitten in her arms, stands watching\\r\\nhim._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s a funny game, uncle. What did you do then?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nA red pawn took a white pawn; this way. You see, Alice, the chessboard is\\r\\ndivided into sixty-four squares, red and white, and the white army tries\\r\\nto win and the red army tries to win. It\\'s like a battle!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nWith soldiers?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, here are the Kings and Queens they are fighting for. That\\'s the Red\\r\\nQueen and here\\'s the White Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nHow funny they look!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nSee the crowns on their heads, and look at their big feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a foot apiece, that\\'s what it is! Do they hump along like this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nHere! You\\'re spoiling the game. I must keep them all in their right\\r\\nsquares.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to be a queen!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nHere _you_ are [_he points to a small white pawn_] here _you_ are in your\\r\\nlittle stiff skirt!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do you do, Alice!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now you are going to move here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me move myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you have traveled all along the board this way and haven\\'t been taken\\r\\nby the enemy you may be a queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do people always play with kings and queens? Mother has them in her\\r\\nplaying cards too. Look!\\r\\n\\r\\n[_ALICE goes to the mantel and takes a pack of playing cards from the\\r\\nledge._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\\'s the King of Hearts and here\\'s his wife; she\\'s the Queen of\\r\\nHearts--isn\\'t she cross-looking? wants to bite one\\'s head off.\\r\\n\\r\\n[_CARROLL moves a pawn._]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\\'re playing against yourself, aren\\'t you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s one way of keeping in practice, Alice; I have friends in the\\r\\nuniversity who want to beat me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if you play against yourself I should think you\\'d want to cheat!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes a nice little girl like you cheat when she plays against herself?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! I _never_ do! I\\'d scold myself hard. I always pretend I\\'m _two_ people\\r\\ntoo. It\\'s lots of fun, isn\\'t it? Sometimes when I\\'m all alone I walk up to\\r\\nthe looking glass and talk to the other Alice. She\\'s so silly, that Alice;\\r\\nshe can\\'t do anything by herself. She just mocks me all the time. When I\\r\\nlaugh, she laughs, when I point my finger at her, she points her finger at\\r\\nme, and when I stick my tongue out at her she sticks her tongue out at me!\\r\\nKitty has a twin too, haven\\'t you darling?\\r\\n\\r\\n[_ALICE goes to the mirror to show Kitty her twin._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ll have to write a book some day about Alice--Alice in wonderland,\\r\\n\"Child of the pure unclouded brow and dreaming eyes of wonder!\" or, Alice\\r\\nthrough the looking glass!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t you wish sometimes you could go into looking-glass house? See!\\r\\n\\r\\n[_ALICE stands on an armchair and looks into the mirror._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s the room you can see through the glass; it\\'s just the same as our\\r\\nliving-room here, only the things go the other way. I can see all of\\r\\nit--all but the bit just behind the fireplace. Oh! I do wish I could see\\r\\nthat bit! I want so much to know if they\\'ve a fire there. You never _can_\\r\\ntell, you know, unless our fire smokes. Then smoke comes up in that room\\r\\ntoo--but that may be just to make it look as if they had a fire--just to\\r\\npretend they had. The books are something like our books, only the words\\r\\ngo the wrong way. Won\\'t there ever be any way of our getting through,\\r\\nuncle?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you think Kitty would find looking-glass milk digestible?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t sound awful good, does it; but I might leave her at home. She\\'s\\r\\nbeen into an awful lot of mischief today. She found sister\\'s knitting and\\r\\nchased the ball all over the garden where sister was playing croquet with\\r\\nthe neighbors. And I ran and ran after the naughty little thing until I\\r\\nwas all out of breath and so tired! I am tired.\\r\\n\\r\\n[_She yawns and makes herself comfortable in the armchair._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Replaces the playing cards on the mantel and consults his watch._]\\r\\n\\r\\nTake a nap. Yes, you have time before tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Half asleep._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'re going to have mock turtle soup for supper! I heard mamma tell the\\r\\ncook not to pepper it too much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARROLL\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a funny little rabbit it is, nibbling all the time!\\r\\n\\r\\n[_He leans gently over the back of her chair, and seeing that she is\\r\\ngoing to sleep puts out the lamp light and leaves the room. A red glow\\r\\nfrom the fireplace illumines ALICE._]\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Dream music. A bluish light reveals the RED CHESS QUEEN and the WHITE\\r\\nCHESS QUEEN in the mirror._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Points to ALICE and says in a mysterious voice._]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere she is, let\\'s call her over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you think she\\'ll come?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ll call softly, Alice!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nHist, Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nHush--if she wakes and catches us--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOTH QUEENS\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice, come through into looking-glass house!\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Their hands beckon her._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Rises, and talks sleepily. The Queens disappear. ALICE climbs from the\\r\\narm of the chair to the back of another and so on up to the mantel ledge,\\r\\nwhere she picks her way daintily between the vases._]\\r\\n\\r\\nI--don\\'t--know--how--I--can--get--through. I\\'ve tried--before--but the\\r\\nglass was hard--and I was afraid of cutting--my fingers--\\r\\n\\r\\n[_She feels the glass and is amazed to find it like gauze._]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, it\\'s soft like gauze; it\\'s turning into a sort of mist; why, it\\'s\\r\\neasy to get through! _Why--why_--I\\'m going _through_!\\r\\n\\r\\n[_She disappears._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE TWO\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Is Scene One, reversed. The portieres are black and red squares like a\\r\\nchessboard. A soft radiance follows the characters mysteriously. As the\\r\\ncurtain rises ALICE comes through the looking glass; steps down, looks\\r\\nabout in wonderment and goes to see if there is a \"fire.\" The RED QUEEN\\r\\nrises out of the grate and faces her haughtily._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, you\\'re the Red Queen!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course I am! Where do you come from? And where are you going? Look up,\\r\\nspeak nicely, and don\\'t twiddle your fingers!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI only wanted to see what the looking glass was like. Perhaps I\\'ve lost my\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know what you mean by your way; all the ways about here belong to\\r\\n_me_. Curtsey while you\\'re thinking what to say. It saves time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ll try it when I go home; the next time I\\'m a little late for dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s time for you to answer now; open your mouth a _little_ wider when you\\r\\nspeak, and always say, \"Your Majesty.\" I suppose you don\\'t want to lose\\r\\nyour name?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet I don\\'t know, only think how convenient it would be if you could\\r\\nmanage to go home without it! For instance, if the governess wanted to\\r\\ncall you to your lessons, she would call out \"come here,\" and there she\\r\\nwould have to leave off, because there wouldn\\'t be any name for her to\\r\\ncall, and of course you wouldn\\'t have to go, you know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nThat would never do, I\\'m sure; the governess would never think of excusing\\r\\nme from lessons for that. If she couldn\\'t remember my name, she\\'d call me\\r\\n\"Miss,\" as the servants do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, if she said \"Miss,\" and didn\\'t say anything more, of course you\\'d\\r\\nmiss your lessons. I dare say you can\\'t even read this book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s all in some language I don\\'t know. Why, it\\'s a looking-glass book, of\\r\\ncourse! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right\\r\\nway again.\\r\\n\\r\\n  JABBERWOCKY\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\\r\\n    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\\r\\n  All mimsy were the borogoves,\\r\\n    And the mome raths outgrabe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems very pretty, but it\\'s _rather_ hard to understand; somehow it\\r\\nseems to fill my head with ideas--only I don\\'t exactly know what they are.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nI daresay you don\\'t know your geography either. Look at the map!\\r\\n\\r\\n[_She takes a right angle course to the portieres and points to them with\\r\\nher sceptre._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s marked out just like a big chessboard. I wouldn\\'t mind being a pawn,\\r\\nthough of course I should like to be a Red Queen best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s easily managed. When you get to the eighth square you\\'ll be a\\r\\nQueen. It\\'s a huge game of chess that\\'s being played--all over the world.\\r\\nCome on, we\\'ve got to run. Faster, don\\'t try to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nFaster, faster.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nAre we nearly there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly there! Why, we passed it ten minutes ago. Faster. You may rest a\\r\\nlittle now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, I do believe we\\'re in the same place. Everything\\'s just as it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course it is, what would you have it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, in our country you\\'d generally get to somewhere else--if you ran\\r\\nvery fast for a long time as we\\'ve been doing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nA slow sort of country. Now _here_ you see, it takes all the running _you_\\r\\ncan do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you\\r\\nmust run at least twice as fast as that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d rather not try, please! I\\'m quite content to stay here--only I _am_ so\\r\\nhot and thirsty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nI know what you\\'d like.\\r\\n\\r\\n[_She takes a little box out of her pocket._]\\r\\n\\r\\nHave a biscuit?\\r\\n\\r\\n[_ALICE, not liking to refuse, curtseys as she takes the biscuit and\\r\\nchokes._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile you\\'re refreshing yourself, I\\'ll just take the measurements.\\r\\n\\r\\n[_She takes a ribbon out of her pocket and measures the map with it._]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of two yards I shall give you your directions--have another\\r\\nbiscuit?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nNo thank you, one\\'s _quite_ enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nThirst quenched, I hope? At the end of three yards I shall repeat\\r\\nthem--for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of _four_, I shall say\\r\\ngood-bye. And at the end of five, I shall go! That Square belongs to\\r\\nHumpty Dumpty and that Square to the Gryphon and Mock Turtle and that\\r\\nSquare to the Queen of Hearts. But you make no remark?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI--I didn\\'t know I had to make one--just then.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRED QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nYou _should_ have said, \"It\\'s extremely kind of you to tell me all this,\"\\r\\nhowever, we\\'ll suppose it said. Four! Good-bye! Five!\\r\\n\\r\\n[_RED QUEEN vanishes in a gust of wind behind the portieres. Rabbit\\r\\nmusic. WHITE RABBIT comes out of the fireplace and walks about the room\\r\\nhurriedly. He wears a checked coat, carries white kid gloves in one hand,\\r\\na fan in the other and takes out his watch to look at it anxiously._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE RABBIT\\r\\n\\r\\nOh the Duchess! the Duchess! Oh! won\\'t she be savage if I\\'ve kept her\\r\\nwaiting!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve never seen a rabbit with a waistcoat and a watch! And a waistcoat\\r\\npocket! If you please, sir--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE RABBIT\\r\\n\\r\\nOh!\\r\\n\\r\\n[_He drops fan and gloves in fright and dashes out by way of the portieres\\r\\nin a gust of wind. ALICE picks up the fan and playfully puts on the\\r\\ngloves. The portieres flap in the breeze and a shawl flies in._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Catches the shawl and looks about for the owner; then meets the WHITE\\r\\nQUEEN._]\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m very glad I happened to be in the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Runs in wildly, both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying, and\\r\\ncries in a helpless frightened way._]\\r\\n\\r\\nBread-and-butter, bread-and-butter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nAm I addressing the White Queen?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, yes, if you call that a-dressing. It isn\\'t my notion of the thing,\\r\\nat all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I\\'ll do it as\\r\\nwell as I can.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I don\\'t want it done at all. I\\'ve been a-dressing myself for the last\\r\\ntwo hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery single thing\\'s crooked, and you\\'re all over pins; may I put your\\r\\nshawl straight for you?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know what\\'s the matter with it! It\\'s out of temper. I\\'ve pinned it\\r\\nhere, and I\\'ve pinned it there, but there\\'s no pleasing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nIt _can\\'t_ go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side, and dear\\r\\nme, what a state your hair is in!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brush has got entangled in it! And I lost the comb yesterday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\n[_Takes out the brush and arranges the QUEEN\\'S hair._]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou look better now! But really you should have a lady\\'s maid!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m sure I\\'ll take you with pleasure.

I never heard of such a thing!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWHITE QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there\\'s one great advantage in it--that one\\'s memory works both ways.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m sure _mine_ only works one way.

There\\'s glory for\\r\\nyou.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know what you mean by \"glory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more\\r\\nnor less.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question is, whether you _can_ make words mean different things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question is, which is to be master--that\\'s all. Impenetrability!\\r\\nThat\\'s what I say!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nWould you tell me, please, what that means?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\r\\n\\r\\nI meant by \"impenetrability\" that we\\'ve had enough of that subject, and it\\r\\nwould be just as well if you\\'d mention what you mean to do next, as I\\r\\nsuppose you don\\'t mean to stop here all the rest of your life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s a great deal to make one word mean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I make a word do a lot of work like that I always pay it extra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALICE\\r\\n\\r\\nOh!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, you should see \\'em come round me of a Saturday night, for to get their\\r\\nwages, you know.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
